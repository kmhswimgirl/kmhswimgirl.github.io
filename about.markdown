## Hi im Kylie, and I really like robotics!

---

A few quick things about me:

- I am currenlty studying Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and will be graduating with my BS in May 2026!
- I chose to study robotics since is super exiting and interesting to me since there is always something to do. Also, having a program you wrote come to life and interact with the physical world is both fascinating and very challenging.
- My favorite OS is Ubuntu Linux (because of ROS!)
- While im not in the lab, I enjoy playing electric guitar and skateboarding.
