# Hi, I'm Kylie!

I'm a Robotics Engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, graduating in May 2026.

## What I'm Working On

I'm passionate about robotics because there's always something new to learn and build. There's something fascinating about writing code that comes to life and interacts with the physical world.

## Recent Projects

Check out my latest work in [Projects](/projects/) or read about my experiences in [Posts](/posts/).

## Tech I Love

- **Favorite OS**: Ubuntu Linux (because of ROS!)
- **Languages**: Python, C++, Bash
- **Robotics**: ROS 2, Gazebo, TurtleBot3

When I'm not in the lab, you'll find me playing electric guitar or skateboarding.
